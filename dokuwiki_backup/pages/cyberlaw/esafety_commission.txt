**Video Overview by [Philippa Dryden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2036tTwIkA)**


The _Enhancing Online Safety for Children Act 2015_ created the independent Office of the Children’s eSafety Commissioner.((_Enhancing Online Safety for Children Act 2015_, s 14.)) The Commissioner enforces the 2-tiered scheme as provided for by the Act, which exists for “the rapid removal from social media services of cyber-bullying material targeted at an Australian child.”((Ibid, s 20)) “Cyber-bullying material targeted at an Australian child” is held to the standard of whether a reasonable person would think that it was directed towards an Australian child and whether it would be “seriously threatening, seriously intimidating, seriously harassing or seriously humiliating the Australian child.”((Ibid, s 5)) 

Parliament stated their intentions that they expect “each social media service will comply with the basic online safety requirements.”((Ibid, s 22))  The system affects the behaviour of end-users both directly and through intermediaries (social media sites). Social media services are affected on a two tier system, with the essential difference in enforcement being that tier 2 services may have action taken against them by the Commissioner.((M do Rozario and A Kogekar, _Australia’s New Cyber-Bullying Watchdog_ (17 April 2015) Corrs Chambers Westgarth http://www.corrs.com.au/publications/corrs-in-brief/australias-new-cyber-bullying-watchdog/)).  The Act also may be used to target end-users who are deemed to have targeted an Australian child with cyber-bullying material through the use of an end-user notice with a number of consequences including removal of the material, refraining from posting such material and apologising.((_Enhancing Online Safety for Children Act 2015_, s 41.))
