======Tilden Rent-A-Car Co v Clendenning (1978) 83 DLR (3d) 400======

**Court**: Ontario Court of Appeal

**Judges**: Dubin, Lacourciere and Zuber, JJ.A.

**Date decided**: 30 March 1978
 
=====Background=====
Dubin JA set out the facts:
>Upon his arrival at Vancouver airport, Mr. Clendenning, a resident of Woodstock, Ontario, attended upon the office of Tilden Rent-A-Car Company for the purpose of renting a car while he was in Vancouver. He was an experienced traveller and had used Tilden Rent-A-Car Company on many prior occasions. He provided the clerk employed at the airport office of Tilden Rent- A-Car Company with the minimum information which was asked of him, and produced his American Express credit card. He was asked by the clerk whether he desired additional coverage, and, as was his practice, he said "yes". A contract was submitted to him for his signature, which he signed in the presence of the clerk, and he returned the contract to her. She placed his copy of it in an envelope and gave him the keys to the car. He then placed the contract in the glove compartment of the vehicle. He did not read the terms of the contract before signing it, as was readily apparent to the clerk, and in fact he did not read the contract until this litigation was commenced, nor had he read a copy of a similar contract on any prior occasion.

The signed document included the term:
>In consideration of the payment of 2.00 per day customers liability for damage to rented vehicle including windshield is limited to NIL. But notwithstanding payment of said fee, customer shall be fully liable for all collision damage if vehicle is used, operated or driven in violation of any of the provisions of this rental agreement or off highways serviced by federal, provincial, or municipal governments, and for all damages to vehicle by striking overhead objects.
Just above the signature box, the document read:
>I, the undersigned have read and received a copy of above and reverse side of this contract

On the back of the contract, “in particularly small type and so faint in the customer's copy as to be hardly legible”, there was a condition that the driver would not consume any alcohol, “whatever be the quantity”.
Clendenning crashed the car into a pole, but successfully argued in front of the trial judge that while he had consumed alcohol, he was not inebriated and was capable of controlling the car.

=====Reasons: Dubin JA (Zuber JA agreeing)=====
Dubin JA held that the disputed terms were “completely inconsistent with the express terms” of the contract:
>The provisions fastening liability for damage to the vehicle on the hirer, as contained in the clauses hereinbefore referred to, are completely inconsistent with the express terms which purport to provide complete coverage for damage to the vehicle in exchange for the additional premium. It is to be noted, for example, that if the driver of the vehicle exceeded the speed-limit even by one mile per hour, or parked the vehicle in a no-parking area, or even had one glass of wine or one bottle of beer, the contract purports to make the hirer completely responsible for all damage to the vehicle. Indeed, if the vehicle at the time of any damage to it was being driven off a federal, provincial or municipal highway, such as a shopping plaza for instance, the hirer purportedly would be responsible for all damage to the vehicle.
Dubin JA considered [[L'Estrange v F Graucob Ltd [1934] 2 KB 394]], noting that it relied on the objective theory of contract. His Honour did not accept, however, that on an objective approach, Tilden could rely upon the fine print clauses:
>Even accepting the objective theory to determine whether Mr. Clendenning had entered into a contract which included all the terms of the written instrument, it is to be observed that an essential part of that test is whether the other party entered into the contract in the belief that Mr. Clendenning was assenting to all such terms. In the instant case, it was apparent to the employee of Tilden-Rent-A-Car that Mr. Clendenning had not in fact read the document in its entirety before he signed it. It follows under such circumstances that Tilden-Rent-A-Car cannot rely on provisions of the contract which it had no reason to believe were being assented to by the other contracting party.
His Honour quoted from Waddams, “The Law of Contracts”, p 91:
>One who signs a written document cannot complain if the other party reasonably relies on the signature as a manifestation of assent to the contents, or ascribes to words he uses their reasonable meaning. But the other side of the same coin is that only a reasonable expectation will be protected. If the party seeking to enforce the document knew or had reason to know of the other's mistake the document should not be enforced.
Dubin JA distinguished ordinary commercial transactions, where it would be reasonable to rely on a signature, with the present case:
>In ordinary commercial practice where there is frequently a sense of formality in the transaction, and where there is a full opportunity for the parties to consider the terms of the proposed contract submitted for signature, it might well be safe to assume that the party who attaches his signature to the contract intends by so doing to acknowledge his acquiescence to its terms, and that the other party entered into the contract upon that belief. This can hardly be said, however, where the contract is entered into in circumstances such as were present in this case.
The case at hand turned on the characteristics of the transaction and the contract:
>A transaction, such as this one, is invariably carried out in a hurried, informal manner. The speed with which the transaction is completed is said to be one of the attractive features of the services provided.
>The clauses relied on in this case, as I have already stated, are inconsistent with the over-all purpose for which the contract is entered into by the hirer. Under such circumstances, something more should be done by the party submitting the contract for signature than merely handing it over to be signed.
After considering the English and Canadian authorities, Dubin JA noted that he saw “no real distinction in contracts such as these, where the signature by itself does not truly represent an acquiescence of unusual and onerous terms which are inconsistent with the true object of the contract, and the ticket cases.”
Dubin JA quoted with apparent approval Waddams, “The Law of Contracts” (590-1):
>These cases suggest that there is a special onus on the supplier to point out any terms in a printed form which differ from what the consumer might reasonably expect. If he fails to do so, he will be guilty of a "misrepresentation by omission", and the court will strike down clauses which "differ from the ordinary understanding of mankind" or (and sometimes this is the same thing) clauses which are "unreasonable or oppressive". If this principle is accepted, the rule about written documents might be restated as follows: the signer is bound by the terms of the document if, and only if, the other party believes on reasonable grounds that those terms truly express the signer's intention. This principle retains the role of signed documents as a means of protecting reasonable expectations; what it does not allow is that a party should rely on a printed document to contradict what he knows, or ought to know, is the understanding of the other party. Again this principle seems to be particularly applicable in situations involving the distribution of goods and services to consumers, though it is by no means confined to such situations.
His Honour then held that it was not necessary to establish fraud, misrepresentation or non est factum:
>In modern commercial practice, many standard form printed documents are signed without being read or understood. In many cases the parties seeking to rely on the terms of the contract know or ought to know that the signature of a party to the contract does not represent the true intention of the signer, and that the party signing is unaware of the stringent and onerous provisions which the standard form contains. Under such circumstances, I am of the opinion that the party seeking to rely on such terms should not be able to do so in the absence of first having taken reasonable measures to draw such terms to the attention of the other party, and, in the absence of such reasonable measures, it is not necessary for the party denying knowledge of such terms to prove either fraud, misrepresentation or non est factum.
Accordingly, Dubin JA found that
>In the case at bar, Tilden Rent-A-Car took no steps to alert Mr. Clendenning to the onerous provisions in the standard form of contract presented by it. The clerk could not help but have known that Mr. Clendenning had not in fact read the contract before signing it. Indeed the form of the contract itself with the important provisions on the reverse side and in very small type would discourage even the most cautious customer from endeavouring to read and understand it. Mr. Clendenning was in fact unaware of the exempting provisions. Under such circumstances, it was not open to Tilden Rent-A-Car to rely on those clauses, and it was not incumbent on Mr. Clendenning to establish fraud, misrepresentation or non est factum. Having paid the premium, he was not liable for any damage to the vehicle while being driven by him.
Dubin JA concluded that the rule in L'Estrange v Graucob did not govern the facts at hand, and it was not necessary to prove misrepresentation; the exclusionary provisions accordingly did not form part of the contract.

=====Reasons: Lacourciere JA (dissenting)=====
Lacourciere JA began by holding that 
>In my view the printing is not difficult to read, and the presence of conditions on the reverse side of the signed contract is brought to the signatory's attention in a very clear way.
His Honour accepted the rule in L'Estrange v Graucob:
>In the wisdom of the common law there has been a traditional distinction with respect to standard form contracts between the position of a person who signed the contract and the one who did not do so. In the absence of duress, fraud or misrepresentation -- and subject to the defence of non est factum -- the former was bound by the printed conditions, even if he or she did not read them[.]
Lacourciere JA found that misrepresentation was not made out. He then proceeded to deal with the alternate suggestion that “the contract contained such unusual and onerous exculpatory terms that the respondent is not bound by them unless the appellant proves that reasonable measures were taken to draw them to his attention”. He began by noting that the cases which enunciated that principle were not binding on the Court, and were often obiter.
His Honour held that
>[...] the common law has traditionally refused to strike down contractual "standard form" conditions unless the terms are "so unreasonable as to amount to fraud, or manifestly irrelevant to the object of the contract"

>The traditional attitude, with which I respectfully agree, has been for Judges to avoid the difficult task of deciding the issue of "reasonableness" of clauses in businesses which compete freely in the market place for consumer support. 
Lacourciere JA was convinced that the problem of unfair clauses was one for the legislature, and one which warranted inteference in the contractual relations of business entities.
